# Terraform Provider for MAAS

This repository contains the source code for the Terraform MAAS provider.

## :warning: Repository ownership and provider name change

The Terraform Provider for MAAS repository now lives under the [Canonical GitHub organisation](https://github.com/canonical) with a new name `github.com/canonical/terraform-provider-maas`.

Ensure you are pointing at the new provider name inside your Terraform module(s), which is `canonical/maas`:

1. Manually update the list of required providers in your Terraform module(s):

    ```diff
    terraform {
      required_providers {
        maas = {
    -     source  = "maas/maas"
    +     source  = "canonical/maas"
          version = "~>2.0"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

1. Upgrade your provider dependencies to add the `canonical/maas` provider info:

    ```bash
    terraform init -upgrade
    ```

1. Replace the provider reference in your state:

    ```bash
    terraform state replace-provider maas/maas canonical/maas
    ```

1. Upgrade your provider dependencies to remove the `maas/maas` provider info:

    ```bash
    terraform init -upgrade
    ```

- **api_url**: URL for the MAAS API server (eg: <http://127.0.0.1:5240/MAAS>).
- **api_version**: MAAS API version used. It is optional and it defaults to `2.0`.

#### `maas`

```hcl
provider "maas" {
  api_version = "2.0"
  api_key = "YOUR MAAS API KEY"
  api_url = "http://<MAAS_SERVER>[:MAAS_PORT]/MAAS"
}
```
