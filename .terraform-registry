Request: GitHub repository https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas that
contained source code for Terraform Provider `maas/maas` was transferred under
Canonical Organization and now lives under https://github.com/canonical/terraform-provider-maas

Because of the ownership change, Terraform Provider now has a new name `canonical/maas`.
We would like to have a redirect from `maas/maas` to `canonical/maas`

Registry Link:
- https://registry.terraform.io/providers/maas/maas/latest
- https://registry.terraform.io/providers/canonical/maas/latest

Request by: anton.troyanov@canonical.com
