<a href="#heading--what-is-this"><h1 id="heading--what-is-this">The MAAS Terraform provider</h1></a>

The MAAS provider is a Terraform provider that allows you to manage MAAS resources using the Terraform (CRUD) tool. This provider can be used to manage many aspects of a MAAS environment, including networking, users, machines, and VM hosts.

These aspects can be divided into three categories of Terraform-compliant HCL:

- [API linkages](#heading--terraform-api-linkage)
- [Data sources](#heading--data-sources)
- [Resources](#heading--resources)

We will deal with each of these categories in turn.  For each data source and resource, we will offer a brief definition and description of how that item is employed in MAAS.  If you are new to [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/), or want to explore what terraforming may provide for your MAAS instance, you may wish to consult the [Terraform documentation](https://www.terraform.io/intro) or one of the many [tutorials available](https://learn.hashicorp.com/collections/terraform/aws-get-started?utm_source=WEBSITE&utm_medium=WEB_IO&utm_offer=ARTICLE_PAGE&utm_content=DOCS).

<a href="#heading--terraform-api-linkage"><h2 id="heading--terraform-api-linkage">API linkages</h2></a>

The schema that provides an API linkage to MAAS from Terraform consists of a standard HCL provider block and a provider API block.  As with all Terraform providers, the provider block contains at least two items:

- a source element, which in this case is "canonical/maas".
- a version element, which can be sufficiently specified by "~>2.0".

The provider block would look something like this:

```nohighlight
terraform {
  required_providers {
    maas = {
      source  = "canonical/maas"
      version = "~>2.0"
    }
  }
}
```

The provider API block contains the necessary credentials to allow Terraform to access your MAAS instance, which include three things:<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Optional

- `api_key` (String) The MAAS API key
- `api_url` (String) The MAAS API URL (eg: http://127.0.0.1:5240/MAAS)
- `api_version` (String) The MAAS API version (default 2.0)
- `tls_ca_cert_path` (String) Certificate CA bundle path to use to verify the MAAS certificate.
- `tls_insecure_skip_verify` (Boolean) Skip TLS certificate verification.



A typical provider API block might look like this:

```nohighlight
provider "maas" {
  api_version = "2.0"
  api_key = "<YOUR API KEY>"
  api_url = "http://127.0.0.1:5240/MAAS"
}
```

A completed definition would also include some data sources and resources, like this typical example:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    maas = {
      source  = "canonical/maas"
      version = "~>2.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "maas" {
  api_version = "2.0"
  api_key     = "<YOUR API KEY>"
  api_url     = "<YOUR API URL>"
}

resource "maas_space" "tf_space" {
  name = "tf-space"
}

resource "maas_fabric" "tf_fabric" {
  name = "tf-fabric"
}

resource "maas_vlan" "tf_vlan" {
  fabric = maas_fabric.tf_fabric.id
  vid    = 14
  name   = "tf-vlan14"
  space  = maas_space.tf_space.name
}

resource "maas_subnet" "tf_subnet" {
  cidr       = "10.88.88.0/24"
  fabric     = maas_fabric.tf_fabric.id
  vlan       = maas_vlan.tf_vlan.vid
  name       = "tf_subnet"
  gateway_ip = "10.88.88.1"
  dns_servers = [
    "1.1.1.1",
  ]
  ip_ranges {
    type     = "reserved"
    start_ip = "10.88.88.1"
    end_ip   = "10.88.88.50"
  }
  ip_ranges {
    type     = "dynamic"
    start_ip = "10.88.88.200"
    end_ip   = "10.88.88.254"
  }
}
```

See the [Terraform HCL documentation](https://www.terraform.io/language) for more details about these blocks.

<a href="#heading--data-sources"><h2 id="heading--data-sources">Data sources</h2></a>

The MAAS Terraform provider offers three data sources, all representing network elements:

- a [fabric](https://discourse.maas.io/t/maas-concepts-and-terms-reference/5416#heading--fabrics), which is essentially a VLAN namespace -- that is, it connects two or more VLANs together.
- a [subnet](https://discourse.maas.io/t/maas-concepts-and-terms-reference/5416#heading--subnets), which is the traditional way of dividing up IP addresses into smaller networks, e.g., 192.168.15.0/24.
- a [VLAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLAN), a "virtual LAN", which is a collection of specific addresses or ports that are connected together to form a restricted network.

Each of these data sources has a specific HCL block with elements structured appropriately to manage that MAAS element.

<a href="#heading--fabric"><h3 id="heading--fabric">Fabric</h3></a>

The [fabric](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/data-sources/fabric.md) data source provides minimal details, namely, the fabric ID, of an existing MAAS fabric.  It takes one argument (the fabric name) and exports one attribute (the fabric ID):

```nohighlight
data "maas_fabric" "default" {
  name = "maas"
}
```

Fabrics within MAAS are not widely manipulated in and of themselves, but rather serve as containers for storing VLAN/subnet combinations.

<a href="#heading--subnet"><h3 id="heading--subnet">Subnet</h3></a>

The [subnet](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/data-sources/subnet.md) data source provides a number of details about an existing MAAS network subnet.  The element takes one argument, the subnet CIDR, and exports a number of attributes:

- id - The subnet ID.
- fabric - The subnet fabric.
- vid - The subnet VLAN traffic segregation ID.
- name - The subnet name.
- rdns_mode - How reverse DNS is handled for this subnet. It can have one of the following values:
-- 0 - Disabled, no reverse zone is created.
-- 1 - Enabled, generate reverse zone.
-- 2 - RFC2317, extends 1 to create the necessary parent zone with the appropriate CNAME resource records for the network, if the network is small enough to require the support described in RFC2317.
- allow_dns - Boolean value that indicates if the MAAS DNS resolution is enabled for this subnet.
- allow_proxy - Boolean value that indicates if maas-proxy allows requests from this subnet.
- gateway_ip - Gateway IP address for the subnet.
- dns_servers - List of IP addresses set as DNS servers for the subnet.

Declaring a subnet looks something like this example:

```nohighlight
data "maas_subnet" "vid10" {
  cidr = "10.10.0.0/16"
}
```

Subnets are the network backbone of MAAS, and thus provide a number of attributes that can be manipulated to alter the behavior of MAAS.

<a href="#heading--vlan"><h3 id="heading--vlan">VLAN</h3></a>

The [VLAN](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/data-sources/vlan.md) data source provides details about an existing MAAS VLAN.  A VLAN takes two arguments:

- fabric - (Required) The fabric identifier (ID or name) for the VLAN.
- vlan - (Required) The VLAN identifier (ID or traffic segregation ID).

A VLAN data source exports a few useful attributes:

- mtu - The MTU used on the VLAN.
- dhcp_on - Boolean value indicating if DHCP is enabled on the VLAN.
- name - The VLAN name.
- space - The VLAN space.

VLAN [spaces](https://discourse.maas.io/t/maas-concepts-and-terms-reference/5416#heading--spaces) are used mostly by Juju, but can be employed by other tools, if desired.

The typical definition of a MAAS VLAN in HCL might look like this:

```nohighlight
data "maas_vlan" "vid10" {
  fabric = data.maas_fabric.default.id
  vlan = 10
}
```

VLANs are available as data sources, but generally, subnets are the workhorses of most MAAS instances.

<a href="#heading--resources"><h2 id="heading--resources">Resources</h2></a>

The MAAS Terraform provider makes a large number of resources available, currently including the following items.  Because of the large number of items, details of arguments and attributes are not duplicated here, but instead provided from a single source at the given links:

- A [maas_instance](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/resources/instance.md) provides a resource to deploy and release machines already configured in MAAS, based on the specified parameters. If no parameters are given, a random machine will be allocated and deployed using the defaults.
- A [maas_vm_host](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/resources/vm_host.md) provides a resource to manage MAAS VM hosts.  Note that MAAS VM hosts are not machines, but the host(s) upon which virtual machines are created.
- A [maas_vm_host_machine](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/resources/vm_host_machine.md) provides a resource to manage MAAS VM host machines, which represent the individual machines that are spun up on a given VM host.
- A [maas_machine](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/resources/machine.md) provides a resource to manage MAAS machines; note that these are typically physical machines (rather than VMs), so they tend to respond differently at times.
- A [maas_network_interface_physical](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/resources/network_interface_physical.md) provides a resource to manage a physical network interface from an existing MAAS machine.  Network interfaces can be created and deleted at will via the MAAS CLI/UI, so there may be more than one of these associate with any given machine.
- A [maas_network_interface_link](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/resources/network_interface_link.md) provides a resource to manage network configuration on a network interface.  Note that this does not represent the interface itself, but the parameter set that configure that interface.
- A [maas_fabric](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/resources/fabric.md) provides a resource to manage MAAS network fabrics, which are [described above](#heading--fabric).
- A [maas_vlan](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/resources/vlan.md) provides a resource to manage MAAS network VLANs, also [described above](#heading--vlan).
- A [maas_subnet](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/resources/subnet.md) provides a resource to manage MAAS network subnets, also [described above](#heading--subnet)
- A [maas_subnet_ip_range](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/resources/subnet_ip_range.md) provides a resource to manage MAAS network subnets IP ranges.  IP ranges carry particular importance when managing DHCP with multiple DHCP servers, for example.
- A [maas_dns_domain](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/resources/dns_domain.md) provides a resource to manage MAAS DNS domains.
- A [maas_dns_record](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/resources/dns_record.md) provides a resource to manage MAAS DNS domain records.
- A [maas_space](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/resources/space.md) provides a resource to manage MAAS network [spaces](https://juju.is/docs/olm/network-spaces).
- A [maas_block_device](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/resources/block_device.md) provides a resource to manage block devices on MAAS machines.
- A [maas_tag](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/resources/tag.md) provides a resource to manage a MAAS tag.  MAAS tags have multiple roles in controlling how machines are configured, booted, and monitored.
- A [maas_user](https://github.com/maas/terraform-provider-maas/blob/master/docs/resources/user.md) provides a resource to manage MAAS users.  This resource does not provide any control over any Candid or RBAC restrictions that may be in place.
