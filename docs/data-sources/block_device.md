# maas_block_device (Data Source)

Collects information about machine block devices by name.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "maas_block_device" "metal-1" {
  name = "sda"
  machine = "host01"
}
resource "maas_block_device" "metal-1-os" {
  machine        = data.maas_block_device.metal-1.machine // previously known - "host01"
  name           = data.maas_block_device.metal-1.name // previously known - "sda"
  id_path        = data.maas_block_device.metal-1.id_path // new information
  size_gigabytes = data.maas_block_device.metal-1.size_gigabytes // new information
  is_boot_device = true
  tags = [
    "os_drive",
  ]
  partitions {
    size_gigabytes = 32
    fs_type        = "xfs"
    label          = "os"
    mount_point    = "/"
  }
  partitions {
    size_gigabytes = 1
    fs_type        = "fat32"
    mount_point    = "/boot"
    bootable       = true
  }
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `machine` (String) The machine identifier (system ID, hostname, or FQDN) that owns the block device.
- `name` (String) The block device name.

### Read-Only

- `block_size` (Number) The block size of the block device. Defaults to `512`.
- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.
- `id_path` (String) Only used if `model` and `serial` cannot be provided. This should be a path that is fixed and doesn't change depending on the boot order or kernel version. This argument is computed if it's not given.
- `is_boot_device` (Boolean) Boolean value indicating if the block device is set as the boot device.
- `model` (String) Model of the block device. Used in conjunction with `serial` argument. Conflicts with `id_path`. This argument is computed if it's not given.
- `partitions` (List of Object) List of partition resources created for the new block device. Parameters defined below. This argument is processed in [attribute-as-blocks mode](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/attr-as-blocks.html). And, it is computed if it's not given. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--partitions))
- `path` (String) Block device path.
- `serial` (String) Serial number of the block device. Used in conjunction with `model` argument. Conflicts with `id_path`. This argument is computed if it's not given.
- `size_gigabytes` (Number) The size of the block device (given in GB).
- `tags` (Set of String) A set of tag names assigned to the new block device. This argument is computed if it's not given.
- `uuid` (String) Block device UUID.

### Nested Schema for `partitions`

Read-Only:

- `bootable` (Boolean)
- `fs_type` (String)
- `label` (String)
- `mount_options` (String)
- `mount_point` (String)
- `path` (String)
- `size_gigabytes` (Number)
- `tags` (Set of String)
