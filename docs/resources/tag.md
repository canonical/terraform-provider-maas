## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The new tag name. Because the name will be used in urls, it should be short.

### Optional

- `comment` (String) A description of what the the tag will be used for in natural language.
- `definition` (String) An XPATH query that is evaluated against the hardware_details stored for all nodes. (i.e. the output of ``lshw -xml``)
- `kernel_opts` (String) Nodes associated with this tag will add this string to their kernel options when booting. The value overrides the global ``kernel_opts`` setting. If more than one tag is associated with a node, command line will be concatenated from all associated tags, in alphabetic tag name order.
- `machines` (Set of String) List of MAAS machines' identifiers (system ID, hostname, or FQDN) that will be tagged with the new tag.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) The ID of this resource.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

```shell
# An existing tag can be imported using its name. e.g.
$ terraform import maas_tag.kvm kvm
```
